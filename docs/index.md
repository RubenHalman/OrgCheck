# Welcome to Org Check


## Introducing “Org Check”

Let admins, devs, customers and partners have an application within their Salesforce org to monitor and help continuously reduce their technical debt.

**How does it work?**

- You install this application directly in the org you want to analyse (sandbox or developer edition).
- Then, you navigate through the tabs in the app to discover some bad practices in the org.
- [Try to install it today in your org!](installation)

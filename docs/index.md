# Welcome to OrgCheck


## Introducing “OrgCheck”

Let customers have an application within their Salesforce org to reduce their technical debt continuously.

**How does it work?**

- You install this application directly in the org you want to analyse (sandbox or developer edition).
- Then, you navigate through the tabs in the app to discover some bad practices in the org.
- More information at (installation)
